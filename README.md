Welcome to the D&D 5e Character Generator by Ethck.
This Character Generator has the ability to randomly generate characters of any level.
Unique to this program is the ability to generate a character sheet from the generated character.
This data from this program is entered into the forms of the
character sheet so that one can still edit the PDF and change
all values.

In order to build the source code you need the following:
- (Python 3.6+)[https://www.python.org/downloads/]
- Then run the main.py file `python3 main.py`

TODO:
