Welcome to the D&D 5e Character Generator by Ethck.
This Character Generator has the ability to randomly generate characters of any level by the rules in the SRD.
Unique to this program is the ability to generate a character sheet from the generated character.

In order to build the source code you need the following:
- (Python 3.6+)[https://www.python.org/downloads/]
- Python JSON library `pip install json`
- Then run the main.py file `python3 main.py`

TODO:
- Player Races
- Multiclassing
- Proiciency bubbles
- Saving Throws (and bubbles)
- Ability Score Increases


Known bugs:
- Wizard class does not work
- Stat mod not working for stat < 10
- Many backgrounds don't give option of traits due to being based off of PHB backgrounds (i.e. soldier)
- No stat requirements for classes
